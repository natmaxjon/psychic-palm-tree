    <h3>Bob's Bio</h3>
    <p> This is Bob. He only exists in your head. Whenever you stop thinking about him, he dies. "I'm terrified", says Bob. Random extra sentence.</p>
    <p> This is Bob. He only exists in your mind. Whenever you stop thinking about him, he dies. Bob's blood is on your hands.
